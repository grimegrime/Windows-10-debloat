# windows-debloat

This is my attempt to make a usable windows 10.

Don't blame me if something goes wrong with your system, not my fault as I am explaining here.

This is a very DEEP debloat script that will speed up your system a ton.

If any questions are needed send me a friend request on discord, will try to respond quickly.

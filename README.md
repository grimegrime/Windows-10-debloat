# windows-debloat

To use, download the file onto your desktop, open it up and drag the file named "debloat.ps1". Once you have done that, right click on it and click "Run with powershell". It will start to delete everything by itself and once it is done it will close automatically. Restart your pc and you will see the drasitc changes.

This is my attempt to make a usable windows 10.

Don't blame me if something goes wrong with your system, not my fault as I am explaining here.

This is a very DEEP debloat script that will speed up your system a ton.

If any questions are needed send me a friend request on discord, will try to respond quickly.
